Example
---------------------------------------------------

::

  cloudprint
  Google username: username@gmail.com
  Password:
  Added Printer Brother-HL-2170W

Examples - Include/Exclude
---------------------------------------------------

Include only the printers "`lp`" and "`2up`":
::

  cloudprint -i lp -i 2up

Exclude all printers whose names start with "`GCP-`":
::

  cloudprint -x GCP-

By default, all printers are included.  For the include and exclude options,
the argument is a regular expression which is matched against the start of the
printer name.

For example, to include all printers whose names begin "`lp`":
::

  cloudprint -i lp # includes both lp and lp2up


Install
---------------------------------------------------

::

  pip install cloudprint
